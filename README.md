[![CI](https://github.com/yetanalytics/project-pan/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yetanalytics/project-pan/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A Clojure library for validating xAPI Profiles, according to the [xAPI Profile specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-profiles).

## Usage

To use the library to validate a whole Profile, call `validate-profile` in the `pan` namespace. This method takes in an entire Profile as an EDN data structure and prints either a success message on success (obviously) or an error message on failure. Similarly, to validate a collection of
Profiles, call `validate-profiles` on them.

Arguments may be supplied for different levels of validation strictness, which are listed as follows:
- `:syntax?` - Basic validation; check only the types of properties and simple syntax of all Profile objects. Default `true`.
- `:ids?` - Validate the correctness of all object and versioning IDs (the id and inScheme properties). Validate that all IDs are distinct and that all inScheme values correspond to valid Profile version IDs.
- `:relations?` - Validate that all relations between Profile objects are valid. These relations are given by IRIs and include the following:
    - the broader, narrower, related, broadMatch, narrowMatch, relatedMatch and exactMatch properties for Verbs, Activity Types and Attachment Usage Types.
    - the `recommendedActivityTypes` property for Activity Extensions
    - the `recommendedVerbs` property for Context and Result Extensions
    - Determining Properties, `objectStatementRefTemplate` property and the `contextStatementRefTemplate` properties for Statement Templates.
    - `sequence`, `alternates`, `optional`, `oneOrMore` and `zeroOrMore` properties for Patterns.
- `:contexts?` - Validate that all instances of `@context` resolve to valid JSON-LD contexts and that they allow all properties to expand out to absolute IRIs during JSON-LD processing. The `@context` property is always found in the Profile metadata and in Activity Definitions, though they can also be found in Extensions for said Activity Definitions.

Other keyword arguments include:
- `:external-profiles` - Extra Profiles from which to reference Concepts, Statement Templates, and Patterns from. These Profiles are not validated. However, IDs in the main Profile(s) will be checked to ensure that they are not duplicated in the extra Profiles. 
- `:print-errs?` - Print validation errors out if true; otherwise return spec error data (or nil, if the profile is valid) without printing. Default `true`.

Besides validating whole Profiles, you can also use library methods and specs to validate parts of Profiles, such as individual  Concepts, Templates and Patterns).

## TODO

- Be able to access external links:
    - Non-inline `schema` values are given by IRIs that link out to external JSON Schemas.
    - Except for the two w3id contexts given by the Profile spec, any and all `@context` values need to be given by external links.
- Log errors to somewhere instead of printing them out.
- More graceful exception handling.
- Any bugs that need to be fixed (natch).
